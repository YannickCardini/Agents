# Eliza

This is a little version of ELIZA, a famous natural-language AI demo from the 1960s.
The program doesn't have a clue what it is saying and it's not difficult to catch it out.

## Example

```text
Hello user, i'm Eliza
> hi
How do you do.  Please state your problem.
> why don't you take over the world ?
Should you take over the world ? yourself ?
> do you remember your last birthday
Yes .. and?
> do you think i'm a lost cause ?
if i'm a lost cause ?? Absolutely.
> I want more friends !
What would it mean if you got more friends !
> what if you could disappear ?
Really--if me could disappear ?
> I'm sorry
I've told you that apologies are not required.
> Goodbye eliza
Goodbye. Thank you for talking to me.
